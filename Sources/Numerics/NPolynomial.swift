// Polynomials of degree N are represented as a vector of size N+1 (0-power to higher powers)
// P(x) = A + B*x + C*x2 + D*x3 -> degree 3, vector of size 4 with these values: [A, B, C, D]
// Note: somehow diverging from NumPy, which sometimes reverses coefficient orders, sometimes not. We pick one.
// Rationale here: lower powers are generally the most significant (around 0 at least, think Taylor
// series), so have them first.
